# Minecraft Plugins

These are just random plugins I decided to make. I find it very fun to make them, so please comment your ideas in the discussion tab! To use the plugins, go into any folder, then find out/artifacts/plugin_name for the jar file. Put that in your plugins folder for your world (I think spigot is required, but if you know more than me, let me know), and run /reload to load the plugins.
